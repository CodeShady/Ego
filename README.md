# Ego -> Python3, but better.

## ~ Syntax ~

### Variables
Variables can be written with this syntax:
```
myName -> "Albert"
```

You can create a constant variable by adding **[const]** :
```
myName[const] -> "Albert"
```

### Print
Try **pout()** for a faster way to type **print()**
```
pout("Hello, World!")
```

### Brackets 乁(ᴗ ͜ʖ ᴗ)ㄏ
Brackets don't do anything special, but might help you organize your code.
```
def sayHi(): {
	pout("Hello!")
}

while True: {
	# Do something here
}
```

### Function Declaration
Instead of **def**, you can use **func** to create a function. This is just a preference, I just think  this syntax looks a little better.
```
func sayHi():
	print("Hello!")
```

### Run your code
```
$ python3 ego.py program.ego
```
